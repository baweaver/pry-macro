# PryMacro

Record command line actions for replaying.

## How is this different from play and history?

You can dynamically make your own command sets and have them saved for
later.

## Why?

* Cycling next to check a variable or content? Macro it.
* Repeating yourself for a workflow? Macro it.
* Auto retry after edits? Macro it.
* Error? Get the source, the stacktrace, and post it? Macro it.
* Going to Google that error? Fetch the error message, and Macro it.
* Someone wrote a bad method? Git blame, irc bot, and Macro it.
* Clever code? Shoot it to hubot to karma that person, and Macro it.

The possibilities here are endless. Make your own command sets as you
REPL along from what you've already written.

## Auto Pilot

Want to "live code" for a presentation? Set it on auto-pilot and let it
code itself. Define a keystroke to "type" the next command and watch it
go.

Why risk it when you can make it look like you're coding?
